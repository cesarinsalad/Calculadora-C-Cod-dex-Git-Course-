This is the first README.md file I ever write so it's probably lackluster.

In short, this repository has served me as a learning tool for git. The program that I commited though, it's actually pretty useful. (And I think that it was a little interesting, but quite simple, nonetheless).

Basically, this is a calculator project (original, I know) programmed in C# where the objective is to write the numbers pressed in the buttons to the textboxes for operating.

This calculator has almost all of the same basic functionalities as any calculator you may see on your phone. Including:

1. Buttons that copy the number in the text property of each button into the selected textbox.

2. Operators that when pressed, provide a visual output of the operation to be made.

3. Clear and backspace button.

4. "+/-" button that changes the value of the number written from positive to negative or viceversa.

NOTE: You can also write the values yourself in the textbox. But then, what's the point?

If someone ever read this, I hope they find it helpful. :)
